                “The people who are crazy enough to think they
                can change the world are the ones who do.”

               <blockquote>
                 “For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every
                 morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of
                 my life, would I want to do what I am about to do
                 today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many
                 days in a row, I know I need to change something.”
               </blockquote>
               <blockquote>
                 “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,
                 and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe
                 is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love
                 what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with
                 all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.”
               </blockquote>
               <blockquote>
                 “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
                 You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”
               </blockquote>
               <blockquote>
                 “Quality is more important than quantity.
                 One home run is much better than two doubles.”
