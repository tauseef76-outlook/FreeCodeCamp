		    	I am a budding self-taught software engineer. My first introduction to programming was using C++ which I was introduced during my graduation. I have since moved on from C++, exposing myself to a variety of different technologies including JavaScript, React.js, and Python. <br />Currently, I am looking to join a dynamic team who are excited about building and transforming software, are interested in diversity, have strong work ehics and adopt the following practices: pair programming, test driven development, continuous integration, frequent releases, user-centred design, fine-grained user stories, refactoring,and continuous improvement.</p>
